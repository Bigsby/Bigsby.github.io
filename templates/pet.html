    A developers life is one of constant learning and sharing. To live the former I'm constantly working on pet projects, usually,
    to try out some new technology, to try out some old technology I missed in my previous learnings or just because it's
    fun. The open source paradigma of today, provides a panoply of ways of sharing knowledge, work and experiences. One of
    the major providers of open source repository is
    <url link="https://github.com/" text="GitHub"></url> and so I, finally, created an account and I've been

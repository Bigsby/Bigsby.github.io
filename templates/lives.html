<p>There is way more fun in live than programming...or course.</p>

        <u>Family</u>,
        <u>children</u> (two of them) and
        <u>friends</u> make sense out of everything...I am a people's person and, in that sense, I'm, truly, a fortunate one.

        <u>Music</u>. Having met my wife in a Jazz school says much of how music is so important a part in my life. It's therapeutical.
        I've played the guitar from around 10 years-old and fell for the trombone when studying jazz. I'm currently playing
        in <a href="http://downtownbigband.com" target="_blank">Downtown Big Band</a>. How fun it is being in the middle
        of the noise.

        <u>Sports</u>. There is virtually no sport, mainly team ones, I'll refuse an invitation to play. As a spectator, I follow,
        more or less close, too many to mention, but Rugby is The Team Sport. COYBG!

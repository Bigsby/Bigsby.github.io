		<h1>Hello!</h1>
		<p>My name is Bruno, I'm a portuguese developer currently living in Ireland. IT-wise, I try everything I get my hands on, at least once and, if I see purpose in it, I stick with it.</p>
		
		<h1>Bio</h1>
		<p>I've been working as a developer for the last since 2007. Before that, I worked as an accountant and, before that, I worked in a call-centre while studying music "in the form of Jazz". When working as an accountant, that, although very respectful a trade, is clearly not for me, I decided to start the journey of becoming a developer. Some time, in 2007, after a little under a year of self-studying nights for it, I figured I was good enough to make a living out of it.</p>
		
		<h1>A developer</h1>
		<p>I started studying, somewhere, in 2006 and I ask the same question I ask today: What's new?. At the time, .Net 3.0 (WPF, WCF and WWF) and Visual Studio 2008 were in beta and, so I went for it. Since them, I've worked professionally or, at least, used in to knowledgeabe level tons of techonolgies such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms754130(v=vs.110).aspx" target="_blank">WPF</a> - Windows Presentation Foundation and cousin <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/" target="_blank">Silverlight</a> (WPF/E for Everywhere).</li>
			<li><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms731082(v=vs.110).aspx" target="_blank">WCF</a> - Windows Communication Foundation</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h1>Pet Projects</h1>
		<p>A developers life is one of constant learning and sharing. To live the former I'm constantly working on pet projects, usually, to try out some new technology, to try out some old technology I missed in my previous learnings or just because it's fun. The open source paradigma of today, provides a panoply of ways of sharing knowledge, work and experiences. One of the major providers of open source repository is <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and so I, finally, created an account and I've been <a href="https://github.com/bigsby" target="_blank">sharing my endeavours on it</a>. Here is a list of the ones I think are, somewhat, relevant:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/Bigsby/Xamarin.Forms.OAuth" target="_blank">Xamarin.Forms.OAuth</a> - A <a href="http://www.nuget.org/" target="_blank">Nuget</a> package that provides authentication for <a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/" target="_blank">Xamarin Forms</a> clients against a long list of <a href="http://oauth.net/" target="_blank">OAuth</a> Identity Providers.</li>
			
			<li><a href="https://github.com/Bigsby/2048.net" target="_blank">2048.net</a> - An implementation of <a href="http://2048game.com/" target="_blank">2048</a> in <a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/" target="_blank">Xamarin Forms</a> that runs (almost) everywhere (Windows 10, Windows 10 IoT in Raspberry Pi, iOS, Android, Windows 10 Mobile)</li>
			
			<li><a href="http://bigsby.github.io/NetCore/" target="_blank">NetCore</a> - Creating .Net Core applications from scratch in Windows (10), Linux (Debian) and Mac OS X (10.11 El Capitan).</li>
		</ul>
